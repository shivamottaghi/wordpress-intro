## The goal
This project's goal is all about having at least two working pages that were created by wordpress
client side. There is some steps prepared by our coaches to follow.

To be honest I really didn't pay much attention to the steps and instead tried to directly dive into
the worpress world, which something tells me that I am going to regret and wish that I followed the
steps.

## How it went
To begin with I made an account in the wrong website. Apparently wordpress.com is the one I should've
gone to, but I did register in wordpress.org and that was the moment I separated my way with the coaches' readme.
It was the first step by the way.

I somehow managed to do some steps that wordpress suggests to launch your website. Decided to make a blog about my
favorite books - thought maybe it'll encourage me to start reading again, nothing has happened yet though, if it did
I'll let you know - and made my first page.

It feels like working with a new software without knowing what you're actually doing but eventually make it work.

I added navbar which has two links, one to home page and one for contact form which doesn't work at the moment

- [ ] make contact link in navbar work

I also would like to add these features:

- [ ] a website logo
- [ ] a nice footer

## Must have features 
Below you'll see what my coaches asked us to prepare.
- [ ] At least 2 pages
  - Both have to have a custom background color, not the original one! (it can be the same color on both pages)
  - Change the footer credit, notice how we cannot remove it? Optionally try hiding it anyway!
- [ ] At least 1 block of every category
  - They can be spread out across all of your pages
  - If you can't find one in the category that does not require a premium account, skip the category.
- [ ] At least 1 hack block!
    - step 12: this block should be styled not by wordpress, but by your own injected CSS
    - Normally we need to get a premium account to add custom css, but there are sneaky ways around it.
- [ ] A contact form
- [ ] A font chosen by you
- [ ] A README on your repository linking to your website
